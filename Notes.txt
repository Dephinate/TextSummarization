1) Unpacking Dictionaries in Python
gen_kwargs = {"length_penalty": 0.8, "num_beams":8, "max_length": 128}
output = pipe(text, **gen_kwargs)[0]["summary_text"] is eqal to output = pipe(text, )[0]["summary_text"]

Build Docker Image of the Source Code
Push Docker Image to ECR
Launch EC2 Machine
Pull Imgae from ECR to EC2
Launch Docker image in EC2

Using CI/Cd, whenever any changes will be made to the code they will be automatically deployed

For CI/CD
1) write github actions yaml
    3 jobs: integration, build and deployment of docker image to ECR container, pull and run the build image on an EC2 instance

2) Add user with required policies in Image. We need EC2 full access and Container registry full access. Download your access keys for step 4

3) Create ECR repo: 088052517375.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/text-s

4) Setup EC2 instance with runner and docker etc

5) Setup secrets to log into EC2 in github secrets to be accessed by github actions
